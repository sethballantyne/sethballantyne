- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sethballantyne
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in games and game engines; primarily engines, these days. I love making games, but making the tech that power games is stupidly fun to make and that's
what matters, right? It's important to me that I create not only enjoyable experiences for players and users, but also good programs. I'm also interested in general assembly
language programming, graphics demos, hacker culture and computing history (particularly the 80s and early 90s). I'm the person who learns a new programming language purely for fun.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (ew :p), DOS graphics programming (HACK THE PLANET!!!!) and playing around with different game engine architectures. I have a project I've
always wanted to do but never did anything with until now. I figure if I don't start it now, when do I? That's where the DOS shit comes in; I have a penchant for punisment obviously. 
I'm always learning *something* new, we belong to a very wide field. I collect programming books too,
so that's a thing.
